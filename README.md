# Block-Chain-
I will implement a node that’s part of a block-chain-based distributed consensus protocol. The BlockChain class is responsible for maintaining a block chain. Since the entire block chain could be huge in size, you should only keep around the most recent blocks. The exact number to store is up to your design, as long as you’re able to implement all the API functions.    Since there can be (multiple) forks, blocks form a tree rather than a list. Your design should take this into account. You have to maintain a UTXO pool corresponding to every block on top of which a new block might be created.
